function time = epochtime(offset);

% usage: time = epochtime( offset );
%
%  returns a double containing the current UNIX epochtime as used in
%  the argus file names.
%  'offset' is an optional offset in minutes from GMT. For example, Pacific
%  Daylight Time is -480. 
%
%  NOTE: if you do not have an offset, then you will get an epoch time
%  based on PACIFIC STANDARD time -- not correct.
%

%  this is a mex file on UNIX. the OS keeps track of this for us. We
%  have to kludge for Windows. We get the "clock" time and measure time
%  from 1 jan 70.
